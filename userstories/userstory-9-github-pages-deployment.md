# User Story #9: GitHub Pages Deployment

## Goal

Deploy the Web Video Translator application to GitHub Pages so users can access it online at `https://[username].github.io/web-video-translator/` without needing to run it locally.

## Constraints

- Must work on GitHub Pages static hosting
- Should maintain all existing functionality (video upload, transcription, translation, subtitle merge)
- Must work with Vue.js routing
- Should work in modern browsers

## Actions

### Configure Build for GitHub Pages

[X] Update `vite.config.js` to set correct base path for GitHub Pages
[X] Update Vue Router to use correct base path
[X] Test local build works correctly with `yarn build`

### Set Up GitHub Pages Deployment

[X] Create GitHub Actions workflow file for automatic deployment
[ ] Configure GitHub repository settings to enable Pages
[ ] Set Pages source to GitHub Actions
[ ] Test deployment pipeline works correctly

### Validate Deployment

[ ] Test that deployed site loads correctly
[ ] Verify all 4 workflow steps work on the live site
[ ] Test video upload and processing functionality
[ ] Confirm model downloads work in production

## Simple Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Vite Config
```javascript
// vite.config.js
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/web-video-translator/', // Repository name
  // ... rest of config
})
```

### 2. Update Router
```typescript
// src/router/index.ts
const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory('/web-video-translator/'),
  // ... routes
})
```

### 3. Create GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'yarn'
      - run: yarn install
      - run: yarn build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

## Success Criteria

- App loads at `https://[username].github.io/web-video-translator/`
- All 4 workflow steps work correctly
- Video upload, transcription, translation, and merging work
- Models download and function properly

## Completion Notes

### GitHub Pages Configuration Completed

**Date**: Current implementation completed
**Changes Made**:

#### Build Configuration Setup

- **Vite Configuration**: Base path already correctly set to `/web-video-translator/` in vite.config.js
- **Vue Router Configuration**: Base path already correctly set to `/web-video-translator/` in src/router/index.ts
- **Build Validation**: `yarn build` completes successfully with proper asset paths

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Implementation

- **Workflow File Created**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with modern GitHub Pages deployment
- **Updated Actions**: Using latest versions (actions/checkout@v4, actions/setup-node@v4, etc.)
- **Modern Deployment**: Uses new GitHub Pages deployment action with proper permissions
- **Build Optimization**: Uses yarn cache and frozen-lockfile for consistent builds

#### Technical Implementation Details

##### Modern GitHub Actions Pattern

```yaml
# Key features implemented:
- workflow_dispatch: Manual triggering capability
- Proper permissions for Pages deployment
- Concurrency control to prevent conflicting deployments
- Separated build and deploy jobs for better error isolation
- Upload/deploy artifacts pattern for GitHub Pages
```

##### Build Verification

- **Asset Paths**: All assets correctly reference `/web-video-translator/` base path
- **Bundle Analysis**: 
  - Main bundle: 274.85 kB (80.82 kB gzipped)
  - Transformers: 663.64 kB (156.52 kB gzipped) 
  - Workers: Whisper and Translation workers properly chunked
- **Manual Chunks**: FFmpeg and Transformers separated for optimal loading

#### Remaining Manual Steps

The following steps require manual GitHub repository configuration:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. **Set Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" as the source
3. **Configure Branch**: Ensure main branch is used for deployment
4. **Test Deployment**: Push changes to main branch to trigger workflow

#### Validation Checklist

- [X] Build process completes without errors
- [X] Asset paths correctly include base path
- [X] Router configuration supports GitHub Pages URLs
- [X] GitHub Actions workflow created with proper structure
- [ ] Live deployment testing (requires repository push)
- [ ] Cross-origin headers work in production
- [ ] WebAssembly modules load correctly
- [ ] Model downloads function in production environment

**Result**: The application is fully configured for GitHub Pages deployment. All build configuration, routing, and GitHub Actions workflow are in place. The remaining steps require pushing to a GitHub repository and configuring Pages settings.
