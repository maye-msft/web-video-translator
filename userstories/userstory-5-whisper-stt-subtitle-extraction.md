# User Story #5: Whisper STT Subtitle Extraction

## Goal

Implement Whisper speech-to-text (STT) functionality using Transformer.js to extract subtitles from audio files and generate SRT format output. Create a dedicated testing page to validate Whisper model loading, audio processing, and subtitle generation before integrating into the main application workflow. This establishes the core subtitle extraction capability for the video translator.

## Constraints

- Must use @xenova/transformers package already included in dependencies
- Should work entirely in the browser without server-side processing
- Must handle large Whisper model downloads with detailed progress feedback and progress bars
- Should support common audio formats (MP3, WAV, M4A)
- Must generate proper SRT format with timestamps and text
- Should provide real-time progress updates during transcription with visual progress indicators
- Must implement model caching to avoid re-downloading on subsequent uses
- Should provide cache management functionality allowing users to reset/clear cached models
- Must handle memory management for large audio files and models
- Should work with the existing Vue 3 and TypeScript setup
- Must include proper error handling for model loading and transcription failures
- Should display cache status and storage usage information

## Completion Notes

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented complete Whisper STT functionality with comprehensive testing interface:

#### Core Components Implemented:
- **WhisperTest.vue**: Full-featured testing page with model management, audio upload, transcription controls, and results display
- **AudioUpload.vue**: Drag-and-drop audio file upload component supporting MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, and FLAC formats
- **whisper.ts**: Core utility module providing Whisper model management, audio processing, and SRT generation

#### Key Features:
- **Model Management**: 6 pre-configured Whisper models (tiny, base, small in English and multilingual variants)
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress bars for model downloads and transcription processing
- **Cache Management**: Browser-based caching with storage size tracking and manual cache clearing
- **Audio Processing**: Browser-based audio preprocessing with resampling to 16kHz for Whisper compatibility
- **SRT Generation**: Complete subtitle format generation with proper timestamps and editing capability
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all failure scenarios
- **Memory Optimization**: Proper cleanup and resource management

#### Technical Architecture:
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Modern reactive components with TypeScript
- **Transformer.js Integration**: Browser-based AI model execution with @xenova/transformers
- **Browser APIs**: Utilizes AudioContext, FileReader, Cache API, and IndexedDB for complete browser-based functionality
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline after initial model download

#### Model Recommendations Documented:
- **Tiny Models**: Fast processing, good for testing and short clips (~39MB)
- **Base Models**: Good balance of speed and accuracy for most use cases (~74MB)
- **Small Models**: Better accuracy, suitable for production use (~244MB)
- **English vs Multilingual**: English-only models are faster and more accurate for English content

#### Performance Considerations:
- **Caching Strategy**: Models are cached locally to avoid re-downloads
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of audio buffers and model resources
- **Progressive Loading**: Visual progress feedback during long-running operations
- **Audio Preprocessing**: Efficient browser-based audio format conversion

#### Testing Coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite covering model configuration, SRT generation, file operations, cache management, and utility functions
- **Mocking Strategy**: Complete browser API mocking for headless testing
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of empty transcriptions, invalid audio files, and cache errors

#### User Experience:
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear workflow from model selection to subtitle download
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, status indicators, and helpful instructions
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling with actionable error messages
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader compatible components

The implementation provides a solid foundation for speech-to-text functionality that can be integrated into the main video translator workflow.
