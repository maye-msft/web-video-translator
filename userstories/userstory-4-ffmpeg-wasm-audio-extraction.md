# User Story #4: FFmpeg WASM Audio Extraction

## Goal

Implement FFmpeg WebAssembly integration to enable audio extraction from uploaded video files. Create a dedicated testing page to verify FFmpeg WASM functionality works correctly in the browser environment before integrating it into the main application flow. This will serve as the foundation for subtitle extraction and video processing capabilities.

## Constraints

- Must use @ffmpeg/ffmpeg and @ffmpeg/util packages already included in dependencies
- Should work entirely in the browser without server-side processing
- Must handle CORS and cross-origin requirements for WebAssembly loading
- Should provide progress feedback during FFmpeg operations
- Must validate that extracted audio files are properly generated
- Should handle memory management for large video files
- Must work with the existing Vue 3 and TypeScript setup
- Should include proper error handling for FFmpeg failures

## Actions

[ ] Create dedicated FFmpegTest page component for testing FFmpeg functionality
[ ] Initialize FFmpeg WebAssembly with proper configuration and CORS settings
[ ] Implement FFmpeg loading with progress feedback and error handling
[ ] Create audio extraction function that converts video to WAV/MP3 format
[ ] Add file download capability for extracted audio files
[ ] Implement progress tracking for FFmpeg operations with visual feedback
[ ] Add memory cleanup and optimization for large file processing
[ ] Create comprehensive error handling for FFmpeg-specific issues
[ ] Add routing to access the FFmpeg test page from main application
[ ] Test with various video formats to ensure compatibility
[ ] Add unit tests for FFmpeg initialization and audio extraction logic
[ ] Document FFmpeg usage patterns and memory considerations
[ ] Commit changes with appropriate git message
