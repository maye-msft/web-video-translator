# User Story #6: MarianMT Subtitle Translation

## Goal

Implement MarianMT machine translation functionality using Transformer.js to translate subtitles between different languages. Create a dedicated testing page to validate MarianMT model loading, subtitle text processing, and translation generation before integrating into the main application workflow. This establishes the core subtitle translation capability for the video translator, allowing users to translate extracted subtitles into their target language.

## Constraints

- Must use @xenova/transformers package already included in dependencies
- Should work entirely in the browser without server-side processing
- Must handle large MarianMT model downloads with detailed progress feedback and progress bars
- Should support common language pairs (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc.)
- Must process SRT format input and generate translated SRT format output
- Should provide real-time progress updates during translation with visual progress indicators
- Must implement model caching to avoid re-downloading on subsequent uses
- Should provide cache management functionality allowing users to reset/clear cached models
- Must handle memory management for large translation models
- Should work with the existing Vue 3 and TypeScript setup
- Must include proper error handling for model loading and translation failures
- Should display cache status and storage usage information
- Must support batch translation of subtitle segments with progress tracking
- Should preserve timestamp formatting and subtitle structure during translation

## Completion Notes

### MarianMT Translation System Implementation

Successfully implemented a comprehensive MarianMT-based subtitle translation system with the following features:

#### Core Components Created:

1. **Translation Utilities (`src/utils/translation.ts`)**

   - 12 pre-configured MarianMT models supporting major language pairs
   - SRT file parsing and generation with timestamp preservation
   - Cache management with storage usage tracking
   - File size formatting utilities
   - Language pair detection and model finding

2. **Translation Service (`src/services/translationService.ts`)**

   - Web worker wrapper for browser-based translation processing
   - Memory usage tracking and reporting
   - Model availability checking

3. **Translation Worker (`src/workers/translationWorker.ts`)**

   - Background translation processing to maintain UI responsiveness
   - Progress tracking during model loading and translation
   - Language prefix mapping for multi-language models
   - Batch processing support for subtitle segments

4. **SRT Input Component (`src/components/SRTInput.vue`)**

   - Dual input methods: paste text or upload file
   - Real-time file validation and preview
   - Responsive design with clear user feedback

5. **MarianMT Test Page (`src/components/MarianMTTest.vue`)**
   - Complete translation workflow testing interface
   - Model selection with size and language pair information
   - Progress tracking for model downloads and translation
   - Cache management and storage usage display
   - Translation results editing and download

#### Language Support:

- **Supported Language Pairs:** English â†” Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese (Simplified), Japanese, Korean, Arabic
- **Multi-language Models:** Handles language prefix mapping (>>jpn<< for Japanese, >>cmn_Hans<< for Chinese)
- **Bidirectional Translation:** Most language pairs support both directions

#### Technical Features:

- **Browser-based Processing:** All translation happens client-side using Transformer.js
- **Model Caching:** Automatic caching with 'transformers-cache' to avoid re-downloads
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress bars for model downloads and translation phases
- **Memory Management:** Efficient handling of large translation models
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for model loading and translation failures
- **Cache Management:** Users can view cache usage and clear cached models

#### Testing:

- **Unit Tests:** 18 comprehensive tests covering all translation utilities
- **Test Coverage:** Language support, SRT processing, cache management, error handling
- **Mock Implementation:** Proper mocking of browser APIs and transformers library
- **Edge Cases:** Empty inputs, invalid formats, network failures

#### Integration:

- **Routing:** Added `/translation-test` route for dedicated testing
- **Navigation:** Integrated into main application navigation
- **Component Architecture:** Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Vue 3 Compatibility:** Full compatibility with existing Vue 3 and TypeScript setup

#### Performance Optimizations:

- **Web Workers:** Non-blocking translation processing
- **Batch Processing:** Efficient handling of multiple subtitle segments
- **Model Reuse:** Cache models between translation sessions
- **Memory Cleanup:** Proper resource management

The MarianMT translation system is fully functional and ready for integration into the main video subtitle workflow. It provides high-quality machine translation with extensive language support and robust error handling.
