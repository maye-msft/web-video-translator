# User Story #1: Setup Development Environment

## Goal

Set up a complete development environment for the web video translator project with proper tooling, devcontainer support, and project structure. This will enable consistent development across different machines and provide all necessary tools for building a single-page application with WebAssembly capabilities.

## Constraints

- Must include devcontainer configuration for consistent development environment
- Should support modern web development with Node.js, yarn package manager
- Must use Vite as the build tool and development server for the SPA
- Must use Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Must include tools for WebAssembly development and testing
- Should be compatible with GitHub Pages hosting requirements
- Need proper folder structure for maintainability and testing

## Actions

[X] Create .devcontainer configuration with Node.js environment
[X] Set up package.json with yarn as package manager and Vite configuration
[X] Configure Vite as the build tool and development server
[X] Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing with proper configuration
[X] Create basic project folder structure (src, tests, e2e, public directories)
[X] Add .gitignore file with appropriate patterns for Node.js, Vite, and Playwright
[X] Configure linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier)
[X] Set up basic HTML entry point and Vite index.html
[X] Add development scripts to package.json (vite dev, build, test, e2e, lint)
[X] Configure Playwright browsers and test setup
[X] Test devcontainer setup and ensure all tools work correctly
[X] Create initial README with setup instructions
[X] Commit the initial project setup
