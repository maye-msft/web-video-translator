# User Story #3: Video File Upload and Display

## Goal

- Should use HTML5 File API for local file handling
- Must validate file types and provide appropriate error messages
- Should display video metadata without requiring server uploads
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS setup
